# Learning Machine Learning

Welcome!  This repository is built for anyone interested in learning more about different facets of machine learning.  Whether you want to learn more about native Python, C++, or the advanced tutorials or algorithms driving state-of-the-art in machine learning and artificial intelligence today, my goal is for this repository to be a resource for your learning in these fields.

I've also been working on an open-source guide for machine learning and AI.  You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XS8DIW_nVHKe8Gfp6hK24GMVcaM4TKbZCMEVxJfdG7Y/edit?usp=sharing) as a set of google docs, as well as [here](https://rmsander.github.io/documentation/index.html) as part of my personal website.  Both of these are continuously evolving and will have more content added to them in time.

## Installation
For full use of all Jupyter notebooks and libraries, please install requirements using either `conda` or `pip`:

- `conda`: `conda env create -f requirements.txt -n local_env python=3.7`
- `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Concepts
For learning about concepts in machine learning, computer vision, operating systems, and programming, please visit the `concepts/` directory to view the different pdf files for these concepts.  Concepts currently covered include:

1. Computer Vision and Deep Learning
2. Introductory Slides on Python

## Python Programming
Exercises and tutorials for learning to program in (mostly native) Python (originally developed for high school students) can be found in `./python/`.  The e exercises cover concepts in:

1. Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, ints/floats)
2. Loops and iteration (for and while)
3. Conditional logic
4. Functions
5. I/O
6. A brief intro to NumPy

## Python Package Tutorials
In addition to the Python exercises above, you can also find tutorials on the following packages in `./python_package_tutorials`.  Note that all of these tutorials are implemented with `.ipynb` files and can be run with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  Tutorials include:

1. `NumPy`
2. `OpenCV`
3. `TensorFlow`
4. `Keras`
5. `PyTorch`
6. `pandas` 

## C++ Programming
Exercises and examples for programming in C++ can be found in `./c++/`.  These examples are mainly derived from exercises with programming drones for autonomous racing in MIT's 16.485: Visual Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles course.  Some examples of code include:

1. Creating a `RandomVector` class that samples a random vector of arbitrary dimension from a uniform distribution.
2. `roscpp` exercises.

## Stata Programming
Stata, a statistical programming language, is also useful for data science, machine learning, and econometrics.  You can find content and examples for stata in   `./stata/`.

## Missing Something?  More Concepts You Would Like to See?
If you have questions or would like content to be added for a specific topic, please feel free to let me know via [this google form](https://forms.gle/yH4NxYYQsqjNexuQ8).  I'm always looking for ways to improve this website and my documentation
