# Tutoring for Machine Learning

This repository is a guide I use for tutoring with machine learning, computer vision, operating systems, and programming.

## Installation
For full use of all Jupyter notebooks and libraries, please install requirements using either `conda` or `pip`:

- `conda`: `conda env create -f requirements.txt -n local_env python=3.7`
- `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Concepts
For learning about concepts in machine learning, computer vision, operating systems, and programming, please visit the `concepts/` directory to view the different pdf files for these concepts.

## Python Programming
Exercises and tutorials for learning to program in (mostly native) Python (originally developed for high school students) can be found in the `python/` directory.

## Python Packages for Machine Learning
Exercises and tutorials for working with different machine learning packages in Python can be found in the `python_package_tutorials/` directory.
