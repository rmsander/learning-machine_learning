# Tutoring for Machine Learning

This repository is a guide I use for tutoring with machine learning, computer vision, operating systems, and programming.

## Installation
For full use of all Jupyter notebooks and libraries, please install requirements using either `conda` or `pip`:

- `conda`: `conda env create -f requirements.txt -n local_env python=3.7`
- `pip`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Concepts
For learning about concepts in machine learning, computer vision, operating systems, and programming, please visit the `concepts/` directory to view the different pdf files for these concepts.  Concepts currently covered include:

1. Computer Vision and Deep Learning
2. Introductory Slides on Python

## Python Programming
Exercises and tutorials for learning to program in (mostly native) Python (originally developed for high school students) can be found in `./python/`.  The e exercises cover concepts in:

1. Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, ints/floats)
2. Loops and iteration (for and while)
3. Conditional logic
4. Functions
5. I/O
6. A brief intro to NumPy

## Python Package Tutorials
In addition to the Python exercises above, you can also find tutorials on the following packages in `./python_package_tutorials`.  Note that all of these tutorials are implemented with `.ipynb` files and can be run with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  Tutorials include:

1. `NumPy`
2. `OpenCV`
3. `TensorFlow`
4. `Keras`
5. `PyTorch`
6. `pandas` 

## C++ Programming
Exercises and examples for programming in C++ can be found in `./c++/`.  These examples are mainly derived from exercises with programming drones for autonomous racing in MIT's 16.485: Visual Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles course.  Some examples of code include:

1. Creating a `RandomVector` class that samples a random vector of arbitrary dimension from a uniform distribution.
2. `roscpp` exercises.

## Python Packages for Machine Learning
Exercises and tutorials for working with different machine learning packages in Python can be found in the `python_package_tutorials/` directory.
